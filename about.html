        <h1>About:</h1>

        <p>
            This is a simple website that lists all of the Pok&eacute;mon games I own. I have a lot of Pok&eacute;mon
            games. This
            website dynamically displays information about each game: an image of the game, and the name of the game;
            and the background
            is color-coded to represent the status of the game in my collection.
        </p>

        <h2>Statement of Purpose:</h2>

        <p>
            I created this website to showcase my collection of Pok&eacute;mon games. I wanted to create a website that
            was
            simple, easy to navigate, and visually appealing. I also wanted to create a website that was dynamic and
            responsive to user input.

        </p>

        <p>As I continue expanding my collection, I will add them to this website. I also have plans to add a page for
            Pok&eacute;mon spin-off games&mdash;the home page only list the mainline Pok&eacute;mon games released for
            the handheld Nintendo systems&mdash;but my collection does not yet include enough spin-off games to
            showcase. </p>

        <h3>
            I hope you enjoy browsing my collection of Pok&eacute;mon games!
        </h3>
